        <h3>The Journey So far </h3>
        <p>So far, I have learnt how to create a web page using <strong>HTML</strong> (HperText Markup Language) which describes the structure of the page. Also i have been taught what tags, elements, and attributes are, and how to use them to write codes on a html document. While <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) is the Language we use to style the web page.

            <li>It defines style for the web page.</li>
            <li>It controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
            <li>Creates better User Experience.</li>
